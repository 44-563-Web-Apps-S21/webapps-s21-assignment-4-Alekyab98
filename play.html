            RUMOUR
        </h6>
        <p class="speech RUMOUR">Open your ears; for which of you will stop
        The vent of hearing when loud Rumour speaks?
        I, from the orient to the drooping west,
        Making the wind my post-horse, still unfold
        The acts commenced on this ball of earth:
        Upon my tongues continual slanders ride,
        The which in every language I pronounce,
        Stuffing the ears of men with false reports.
        I speak of peace, while covert enmity
        Under the smile of safety wounds the world:
        And who but Rumour, who but only I,
        Make fearful musters and prepared defence,
        Whiles the big year, swoln with some other grief,
        Is thought with child by the stern tyrant war,
        And no such matter? Rumour is a pipe
        Blown by surmises, jealousies, conjectures
        And of so easy and so plain a stop
        That the blunt monster with uncounted heads,
        The still-discordant wavering multitude,
        Can play upon it. But what need I thus
        My well-known body to anatomize
        Among my household? Why is Rumour here?
        I run before King Harry's victory;
        Who in a bloody field by Shrewsbury
        Hath beaten down young Hotspur and his troops,
        Quenching the flame of bold rebellion
        Even with the rebel's blood. But what mean I
        To speak so true at first? my office is
        To noise abroad that Harry Monmouth fell
        Under the wrath of noble Hotspur's sword,
        And that the king before the Douglas' rage
        Stoop'd his anointed head as low as death.
        This have I rumour'd through the peasant towns
        Between that royal field of Shrewsbury
        And this worm-eaten hold of ragged stone,
        Where Hotspur's father, old Northumberland,
        Lies crafty-sick: the posts come tiring on,
        And not a man of them brings other news
        Than they have learn'd of me: from Rumour's tongues
        They bring smooth comforts false, worse than
        true wrongs.

<p class="speech NORTHUMBERLAND" >What news, Lord Bardolph? every minute now
Should be the father of some stratagem:<br>
The times are wild: contention, like a horse<br>
Full of high feeding, madly hath broke loose<br>
And bears down all before him.</p>
<h6 class="name"LORD BARDOLPH></h6>
<p class="speech LORD-BARDOLPH"> earl,<br>
I bring you certain news from Shrewsbury.</p>
<h6 class="name"NORTHUMBERLAND></h6>
<p class="speech NORTHUMBERLAND">Good, an God will!</p>
<h6 class="name" BARDOLPH></h6>
<p class="speech LORD-BARDOLPH"> good as heart can wish:<br>
The king is almost wounded to the death;<br>
And, in the fortune of my lord your son,<br>
Prince Harry slain outright; and both the Blunts<br>
Kill'd by the hand of Douglas; young Prince John<br>
And Westmoreland and Stafford fled the field;<br>
And Harry Monmouth's brawn, the hulk Sir John,<br>
Is prisoner to your son: O, such a day,<br>
So fought, so follow'd and so fairly won,<br>
Came not till now to dignify the times,<br>
Since Caesar's fortunes!</p>
<h6 class="name" NORTHUMBERLAND></h6>
<p class="speech NORTHUMBERLAND">how  is this derived?<br>
Saw you the field? came you from Shrewsbury?</p>
<h6 class="name" LORD BARDOLPH></h6>
<p class="speech LORD-BARDOLPH"> spake with one, my lord, that came from thence,<br>
A gentleman well bred and of good name,<br>
That freely render'd me these news for true.</p>
<h6 class="name"NORTHUMBERLAND></h6>
<p class="speech NORTHUMBERLAND">
Here comes my servant Travers, whom I sent
On Tuesday last to listen after news.
<h6 class ="stage-direction" TRAVERS>

<h6 class="name"LORD BARDOLPH></h6>
<p class="speech LORD-BARDOLPH"> My lord, I over-rode him on the way;<br>
And he is furnish'd with no certainties<br>
More than he haply may retail from me.</p>
<h6 class="name"NORTHUMBERLAND></h6>
<p class="speech NORTHUMBERLAND"> Now, Travers, what good tidings comes with you?</p>
<h6 class="name" TRAVERS></h6>
<p class="speech TRAVERS"> lord, Sir John Umfrevile turn'd me back <br>
With joyful tidings; and, being better horsed,<br>
Out-rode me. After him came spurring hard<br>
A gentleman, almost forspent with speed,<br>
That stopp'd by me to breathe his bloodied horse.<br>
He ask'd the way to Chester; and of him<br>
I did demand what news from Shrewsbury:<br>
He told me that rebellion had bad luck<br>
And that young Harry Percy's spur was cold.<br>
With that, he gave his able horse the head,<br>
And bending forward struck his armed heels<br>
Against the panting sides of his poor jade<br>
Up to the rowel-head, and starting so<br>
He seem'd in running to devour the way,<br>
Staying no longer question.</p>
<h6 class="name"NORTHUMBERLAND></h6>
<p class="speech NORTHUMBERLAND">Hey! Again:<br>
Said he young Harry Percy's spur was cold?<br>
Of Hotspur Coldspur? that rebellion<br>
Had met ill luck?</p>
<h6 class="name"LORD BARDOLPH></h6>
<p class="speech LORD-BARDOLPH"> lord, I'll tell you what;<br>
If my young lord your son have not the day,<br>
Upon mine honour, for a silken point<br>
I'll give my barony: never talk of it.</p>
<h6 class="name"NORTHUMBERLAND></h6>
<p class="speech NORTHUMBERLAND"> should that gentleman that rode by Travers<br>
Give then such instances of loss?<br>
<h6 class="name"LORD BARDOLPH></h6>
<p class="speech LORD-BARDOLPH">who, he?<br>
He was some hilding fellow that had stolen<br>
The horse he rode on, and, upon my life,<br>
Spoke at a venture. Look, here comes more news.</p>
