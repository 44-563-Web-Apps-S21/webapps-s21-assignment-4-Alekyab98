        <p class="speech NORTHUMBERLAND"> this man's brow, like to a title-leaf,<br>
        Foretells the nature of a tragic volume:<br>
        So looks the strand whereon the imperious flood<br>
        Hath left a witness'd usurpation.<br>
        Say, Morton, didst thou come from Shrewsbury?</p>
        <h6 class="name">MORTON</h6>
        <p class="speech MORTON"> ran from Shrewsbury, my noble lord;<br>
        Where hateful death put on his ugliest mask<br>
        To fright our party.</p>
        <h6 class="name">NORTHUMBERLAND</h6>
        <p class="speech NORTHUMBERLAND"> doth my son and brother?<br>
        Thou tremblest; and the whiteness in thy cheek<br>
        Is apter than thy tongue to tell thy errand.<br>
        Even such a man, so faint, so spiritless,<br>
        So dull, so dead in look, so woe-begone,<br>
        Drew Priam's curtain in the dead of night,<br>
        And would have told him half his Troy was burnt;<br>
        But Priam found the fire ere he his tongue,<br>
        And I my Percy's death ere thou report'st it.<br>
        This thou wouldst say, 'Your son did thus and thus;<br>
        Your brother thus: so fought the noble Douglas:'<br>
        Stopping my greedy ear with their bold deeds:<br>
        But in the end, to stop my ear indeed,<br>
        Thou hast a sigh to blow away this praise,<br>
        Ending with 'Brother, son, and all are dead.'</p>
