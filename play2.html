        <p class="speech NORTHUMBERLAND"> this man's brow, like to a title-leaf,
        Foretells the nature of a tragic volume:
        So looks the strand whereon the imperious flood
        Hath left a witness'd usurpation.
        Say, Morton, didst thou come from Shrewsbury?</p>
        <h6 class="name">MORTON</h6>
        <p class="speech MORTON"> ran from Shrewsbury, my noble lord;
        Where hateful death put on his ugliest mask
        To fright our party.</p>
        <h6 class="name">NORTHUMBERLAND</h6>
        <p class="speech NORTHUMBERLAND"> doth my son and brother?
        Thou tremblest; and the whiteness in thy cheek
        Is apter than thy tongue to tell thy errand.
        Even such a man, so faint, so spiritless,
        So dull, so dead in look, so woe-begone,
        Drew Priam's curtain in the dead of night,
        And would have told him half his Troy was burnt;
        But Priam found the fire ere he his tongue,
        And I my Percy's death ere thou report'st it.
        This thou wouldst say, 'Your son did thus and thus;
        Your brother thus: so fought the noble Douglas:'
        Stopping my greedy ear with their bold deeds:
        But in the end, to stop my ear indeed,
        Thou hast a sigh to blow away this praise,
        Ending with 'Brother, son, and all are dead.'</p>
